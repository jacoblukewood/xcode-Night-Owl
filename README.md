# xcode-Night-Owl

This is an Xcode port of the Night Owl Theme inspired from the theme created by [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras) and modified by [Jacob Wood](https://github.com/jacoblukewood) to use the Operator Mono theme.

Find the original Dank Mono version [here](https://github.com/stealthanthrax/xcode-Night-Owl).

## Installation
To install this theme:
1. Ensure Operator Mono is installed (https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator).
2. Navigate to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`.
3. Copy the `night-owl.xccolortheme` file to the `FontAndColorThemes` folder. **Ensure macOS does not automatically append .txt to the file end or Xcode will not recognise it!**
4. Open Xcode and open the preferences window (`cmd + ,`)
5. Navigate to `Fonts & Colors` tab.
6. Select `night-owl` from the side menu.
